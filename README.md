# DiscordSearchDeleter
A Tampermonkey Script for mass message deletion from specific search results. 
This script that allows you to mass delete discord messages by searching for them (with discord built in search) and then pressing Ctrl+Shift+Y to delete them. Remember that you need to search for it first. Also, if you don't have tampermonkey, you can just use it using F12 console.
